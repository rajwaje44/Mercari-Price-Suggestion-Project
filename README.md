### Mercari-Price-Suggestion-Project

1.	Introduction:
   The modern age is the age of machine intelligence. These are such buzzwords that has taken the world by storm and almost every avenue has enjoyed the flavor of Machine          Learning in some way. In this report we are going to take you through a real-world data science problem which we have picked from Kaggle’s live competition and will              demonstrate our way of solving it.
   This case study solves everything right from scratch. So, you will get to see each and every phase of how in the real world, a case study is solved. Before we talk about our    approach of solving the problem, let us know what Mercari is.

   About Mercari:
   Mercari is an online shopping marketplace which is powered by one of the biggest community of Japan where users can sell pretty much anything. The community wants to offer      price suggestions to the sellers but is a tough task as the sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari’s marketplace

2.	Problem Statement:
   •	It can be hard to know how much something’s really worth. Small details can mean big differences in pricing. For example, one of these sweaters cost 335 dollars and the          other cost 9.99 dollars. Can you guess which one’s which?
     Sweater A: Vince, Long sleeve, Turtle neck pullover sweater, Black, Size L, Great condition
     Sweater B: St. John's Bay Long sleeve, Turtle neck Pullover sweater, Size L, Great condition
   •	Hence, it's harder to guess or decide what price which product should have
   •	Product pricing gets even harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. Clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily influenced by          brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs.
 
3.	Challenges to solve:
   •	The task of this Project is to build an algorithm that suggests the right product prices for shopping app from product name, user inputted text descriptions of the product,      category name, brand name, item condition, and shipping information
   •	The goal is about creating a model that would help sellers to price their products. Pricing should be intermediate between sellers and buyers
   •	Making it easy for the sellers to mark the prices of new products on the website, after taking into account the previously collected data
   •	Understand what the data is trying to tell us through EDA


4.	Our Objectives:
    1. • Data Cleaning • Pre-processing • Feature Engineering
    2.	Exploratory Data Analysis:
       •	Gathering as many insights as possible through Exploratory Data Analysis.
       •	Trying to see through Descriptive Statistics that what our data is trying to tell us and understand the significance of each and every variable.
    3.	Text Processing:
       •	Natural Language Processing (NLP)
       •	Tokenizing and tf-idf algorithm
       •	K-means Clustering
    4.	The given problem is exactly about predicting the price, which is a real-valued value, thus it falls into the Regression Category
    5.	Trying to provide some interpretability and evolving our ways to handle the upcoming problems as we proceed through our project
